# Titanic Survival Predictions
Ever wondered how you would have fared on the Titanic? Well, lets find out!

This Machine Learning model predicts the chances of passenger survival on the Titanic with 80% accuracy. 

It goes step-by-step from data extaction, preprocessing till the final model and discussion.
9 models are built with each improving on the other.
